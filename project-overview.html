  <div class="col-md-8"<h2>We started to dissect the Quadcopter by removing the central shell of the machine. Quite a grizzly sight, there was a lot of careful surgical work to be done to remove the control unit while keeping the rest of the electronics in tact. </h2></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8"><h3>Things were coming together. The motors were all wired up to the breadboard, and the gyroscope was fixed to the centre of the Quadcopter to generate the most accurate readings possible.</h3></div>
